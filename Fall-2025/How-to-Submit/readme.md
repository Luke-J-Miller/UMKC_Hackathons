- **Live Demo**: Showcase the functionality, key features, or results of your project
- **Conclusion**: Highlight the projectâ€™s impact, innovation, and potential for future work
Ensure your video title is "Team XX UMKC Fall 2025 Hack-A-Thon". You may change the title after the event.  Also ensure privacy is public or anyone with the link.  If you select, 'No, It's not made for kids' it will make your video available more quickly.

## Questions and Answers
### Why all the changes?
The organizers are a few dedicated PhD students with significant demands on their time.  We are making changes to preserve their time and make a smoother event.
### In previous years, we could upload videos and posters to Google docs, Panopto, Box, etc.  Is this still allowed?
No.  This has caused considerable pain in past years with broken links, access issues, etc.  Additionally, YouTube videos allow us to group videos into playlists by track for review by judges.  YouTube is the only allowed format.
### We used to be able to use different size posters.  Does it have to be 36"x48"?
People were frequently confused on allowable sizes.  Additionally, this is a live event and it is strange to have someone's poster significantly different sized than others.  36"x48" landscape is the only allowed format.
### Last year, I was able to submit my poster as a powerpoint. Does it have to be PDF?
Yes. Powerpoints are much larger files than PDFs.  We send these files directly to judges, upload them to the website and github, and email them for printing. Smaller files enables this to be done without zipping or working through links to cloud storage.
### Do I have to use the provided template poster? Can it be modified?
You may create your own poster using whatever methods you like or modify the template.  The poster must still meet all the requirements.
